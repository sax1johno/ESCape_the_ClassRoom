/**
 * Observable actor logic is described by an observable stream of values. Actors created from observable logic (“observable actors”) can:
 *
 * - Emit snapshots of the observable’s emitted value
 *
 * The observable’s emitted value is used as its observable actor’s `context`.
 *
 * Sending events to observable actors will have no effect.
 *
 * @param observableCreator A function that creates an observable. It receives one argument, an object with the following properties:
 * - `input` - Data that was provided to the observable actor
 * - `self` - The parent actor
 * - `system` - The actor system to which the observable actor belongs
 *
 * It should return a {@link Subscribable}, which is compatible with an RxJS Observable, although RxJS is not required to create them.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { fromObservable, createActor } from 'xstate'
 * import { interval } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const logic = fromObservable((obj) => interval(1000));
 *
 * const actor = createActor(logic);
 *
 * actor.subscribe((snapshot) => {
 *   console.log(snapshot.context);
 * });
 *
 * actor.start();
 * // At every second:
 * // Logs 0
 * // Logs 1
 * // Logs 2
 * // ...
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link https://rxjs.dev} for documentation on RxJS Observable and observable creators.
 * @see {@link Subscribable} interface in XState, which is based on and compatible with RxJS Observable.
